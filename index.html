                This website was built using plain html and css. You can find the source on <a

            <p>
                At Paytree, I develop a payment platform mostly used on events like festivals. This platform includes:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    A dashboard for product and cash register management, and statistics;
                </li>

                <li>
                    A mobile POS Android app used by the cashiers, where they can select products and pay using various
                    payment
                    methods, including NFC balance cards and contactless card payments;
                </li>

                <li>
                    A customer-facing balance card website, where users can see their balance and past orders, and
                    top-up
                    their
                    balance cards using iDeal;
                </li>

                <li>
                    And an API that powers all of this.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                The Paytree dashboard is built with Material UI for styling as well, but on top of plain React.js for
                now. I
                plan to move this to Next.js as well in the future.
            </p>

            <p>
                The mobile POS app is built with <a href="https://flutter.dev/" target="_blank"
                                                    rel="noreferrer noopener">Flutter</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                The API that powers both of these is built using <a href="https://ktor.io/" target="_blank"
                                                                    rel="noreferrer noopener">Ktor</a>, <a
                    href="https://insert-koin.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Koin</a>, <a

                and backed by a <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PostgreSQL</a>
                database.
            </p>

            <p>
                All of this is deployed to and built using Google Cloud.

        <div class="card-content">
            <p>
                In 2013, I discovered my passion for programming, which was sparked by watching <a
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Daniel
                Shiffman</a>
                completing challenges set by his audience. I began my formal programming education in 2017, following
                the
                fundamentals I had learned in <a href="https://processing.org/" target="_blank"
                                                 rel="noreferrer noopener">Processing</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                From October 2018 to March 2019, I had the privilege of participating in an international internship in
                the United Kingdom. During this time, I specialized in Node.js for back-end development. One of the most
                valuable skills I acquired was the use of Async.js, which led to my proficiency in callbacks, as an
                alternative
                to the conventional async/await approach.
            </p>

            <p>
                As a hobby, I enjoy playing the drums, which I started fairly recently. My expertise with the drums has
                been primarily self-taught, and I make it a point to practice daily, constantly seeking to master new
                songs.
            </p>

            <p>
                Video games have been a significant part of my life for as long as I can recall. My all-time favorite
                game is The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, followed closely by <a href="https://clonehero.net/"
                                                                                     target="_blank"
                                                                                     rel="noreferrer noopener">Clone
